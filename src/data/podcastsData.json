        "Ever since I have started on the path of pursuing educational psychology, I have been trying to search for more materials to learn more about this field of psychology. At first, this wasn't an easy task as, in comparison to other fields of psychology, there seems to be a gap in understanding educational psychology, which made this search harder than it should be, especially when the common materials available are mostly tailored to the American school system. However, I have found a good range of materials and podcasts that are extremely informative and helpful for someone working in the education system, particularly within the UK education system, with some from other countries."
